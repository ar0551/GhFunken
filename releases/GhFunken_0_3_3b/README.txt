------------------------------------------------------------

Funken repo: https://github.com/astefas/Funken
GhFunken repo: https://github.com/ar0551/GhFunken/

--- Setup
1 - Install the Funken Arduino library (see instructions in folder "00_Funken_ArduinoLibrary").
2 - Install the GhFunken Grasshopper plugin (see instructions in folder "01_GhFunken_Grasshopper").
3 - Installation is complete!

--- Usage

--- Arduino
1 - Open your Arduino IDE, and navigate to one of the Funken examples under File -> Examples -> Funken. The example "02_BasicArduino" is a good point where to start.
2 - Connect your Arduino (or any Arduino-compatible) board and upload the selected code.
3 - You can use the Serial Monitor to test your code. Just make sure you set the line ending to "Both CL & NL" and the baud to 57600. Try sending a command (e.g. "CLIST"), and you should get a response from the board.

--- Grasshopper
4 - Open one of the provided GhFunken example files (e.g. "00_Blink.gh") and follow the included instructions.
5 - Have fun building awesome tools and interactions with Funken!
