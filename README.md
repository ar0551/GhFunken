# GhFunken
Grasshopper interface (GPL) to the [Funken](https://github.com/astefas/Funken) Serial Protocol Toolkit.

GhFunken is a Grasshopper plug-in that interfaces to the Funken Serial Protocol Toolkit. It offers classes to initiate communication with Funken-Enabled Arduino devices, send commands and handle responses. On a more general level, it allows to fully remote control an Arduino-based device running Funken from Grasshopper, without need to access directly the Arduino code.

Funken is a [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) [library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries) that enables [callbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) on an arduino. It is part of a workflow that simplifies communication between your Arduino and any host, that is able to speak to it via serial messages.
For more info on Funken, see the [Funken Repository](https://github.com/astefas/Funken).

GhFunken is build on top of [PyFunken](https://github.com/ar0551/PyFunken) and [PySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial).


## How to use GhFunken
GhFunken acts as an interface to send commands to an Arduino devices running a Funken implementation. Hence, to work properly, GhFunken assumes you kwow what protocol is defined in the Funken implementation running on the Arduino. For more details on how to define your own protocol using Funken, see [here](https://github.com/astefas/Funken#how-to-use-funken). For basic Arduino protocols which are shipped with Funken, see [here](https://github.com/astefas/Funken/blob/master/README.md#quickstart).
